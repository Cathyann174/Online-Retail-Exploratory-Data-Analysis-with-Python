Case Study


In this project, I worked with transactional data from an online retail store.
The dataset contained information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.
My task was to explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.
By conducting exploratory and statistical data analysis, I identied patterns, outliers, and correlations, allowing me to make data-driven decisions and recommendations
to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.
Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I uncovered key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. 
Ultimately, this project aimed to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

Recommendation

Increase stocks in the top selling products.

Create special offers for our customers in the United Kingdom to encourage more purchasing.

Open on Saturdays.

On the busy months have promotions to encourage more purchasing.

Conduct a survey for the customers that we have low purchasing, to learn what is deterring them.

Take a closer look at the abnormal figures because this can be deterring customers from purchasing.
