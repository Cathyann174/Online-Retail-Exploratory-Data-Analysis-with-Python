Case Study


In this project, I worked with transactional data from an online retail store.
The dataset contained information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.
My task was to explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.
By conducting exploratory data analysis, I identied patterns, outliers, and correlations, allowing meto make data-driven decisions and recommendations
to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.
Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I uncovered key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. 
Ultimately, this project aimed to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.
